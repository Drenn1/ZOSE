ZOSE changelog

v0.7.00:

* Rewrote the ASM patches to allow all of the "jump" opcodes to be used in all
contexts, and to be less intrusive in general. If you previously used an older
ZOSE version, you will need to click "Re-apply ASM patches" for this to take
effect.

* Allow "jump" opcodes to take absolute addresses (same format as the
"writelocation" opcode).

* Fixed the endianness of many opcodes, including:
  * dw
  * setzspeed
  * showtext (when only 1 parameter passed)
  * settextid
  * 2-byte jump opcodes

* Fixed "lowindex" text opcodes (not that anyone will use them anyway...)
