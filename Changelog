ZOSE changelog

v0.7.00:

* Rewrote the ASM patches to allow all of the "jump" opcodes to be used in all
contexts, and to be less intrusive in general.

* Allow "jump" opcodes to take absolute addresses (same format as
"writelocation" opcode)

* Fixed the endianness of many opcodes, including:
  * dw
  * setzspeed
  * showtext (when only 1 parameter passed)
  * settextid
  * 2-byte jump opcodes

* Fixed "lowindex" text opcodes (not that anyone will use them anyway...)
